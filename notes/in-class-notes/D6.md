# Angular

Angular (not AngularJS) is a front-end framework used to build component-based single page applications.

## What is a component?
- A Building block of an angular application
- Our angular application is built upon these components which are almost like reusable html-elements with their own formatting, styling, and functionality
    - Whenever we generate a component we get an HTML file, a CSS file and a TS file for just that component
- The goal for this is to create an application that can be rendered dynamically (You can render complex element based off conditionals or interation)

## What is a SPA (Single Page Application)?

- A whole-frontend loaded as one single page
- Why would we want to do this?
    - By creating a SPA we receive a lot of benefits:
        - UI interactions happen quickly
        - Load time between "pages" is usually very low
        - Caching capabilities
    
- How do Angular create a single page application?
    - Angular uses routing to simulate different pages
    - Routing allows us to dynamically render specific components to the page whenever we want to see them
    - When we're ready to deploy our app, Angular bundles all of our components together into a single page so it can all be deployed together

- What are some disadvantages to SPA?
    - It takes longer to load initially
    - Less secure against cross-site scripting (CORS policy)
    - Don't perform well with SEO (Search Engine Optimization)
