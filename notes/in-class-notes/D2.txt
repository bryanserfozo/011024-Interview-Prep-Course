OOP --> Object Oriented Programming
	- Creation and maintence of objects (virtualizations of read world things)
	- By updating and manipulating the state of these objects we can do logic and complete tasks
4 Pillars of OOP?
	- Encapsulation -> Providing a way to protect the data inside an object and only allow specific alterations
	- Abstraction -> Hiding implementation details to simplify interfaces
	- Inheritance -> Passing down state and functionality from a parent class to a child class
	- Polymorphism -> Means many forms. Refers to how we can update methods to have multiple functionality 			despite the same name

Abstraction is generally the hardest Pillar to fully understand. It is achieved through the use of interfaces and abstract classes. 
	- Abstract classes (use the abstract keyword) are classes that cannot be instantiated (they're meant to be 	inherited). They contain both concrete methods (methods with a method body) and abstract methods (methods 	that must be implemented in the inheriting class.

	- Interfaces are structures in java that are also abstract. They only contain abstract methods (not 	including any default/static methods) and you can inherit multiple interfaces. Used to describe qualities



ArrayList:
	[1,2,3] --> Retrieval is fast
	[1,2,3,4,5,6] --> Needs to copy and resize several times to accomodate the change (slower)

LinkedList:
	1 -> 2 -> 3 --> Retrieval is slower
	1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3 --> Insertion/Deletion is faster since it just needs to update a pointer
