## What is Spring?
- Spring is an umbrella term for a family of frameworks designed to create enterprise-level loosely-coupled Java applications
	- Spring utilizes Dependency Injection to help control how our application is put together
		- Dependency Injection is a design pattern where we remove our class dependencies to some external configuration, like an XML file, a configuration file, or anything else really
		- If Class A depends on Class B we say that Class A is DEPENDENT on Class B and we'll inject the dependency as needed
	- Anything we want Spring to handle we need to declare as a Bean in some capacity
		- A Bean is just a class the Spring manages
	- Inversion of Control (IOC)
		- By Inverting some of our control (aka giving control for custom calls to the framework) we free up our minds to not focus on configuration or structure and rather spend our developing actual business logic
		- Inversion of Control has many real-life analogies
			- Everytime you go to a restaurant you invert control of your food over to the restaurant. 	You don't need to worry about having ingredients, cooking the food, having the proper equipment or dishes to clean afterwards, so this frees up your mind to complete other tasks (i.e. chatting with friends and family, completing work, or just relaxing). 

			- Everytime you get in an Uber (or a cab), you invert control of driving over to another individual who handles getting you from point a to point b. This is useful since it can free up both time and financial resources so you can do other things with those resources


## Spring Projects
- Spring Projects as smaller, sub-frameworks within the Spring family of frameworks that have one specific goal in mind (i.e. web services, data manipulation, security, cloud resources etc.). The idea behind having all of these projects is for them to be plug-and-play. So you can add in whatever dependency you need and you should have all the pieces necessary to work with that project

	- Spring Web MVC
		- We'll be using this to manage HTTP endpoints and create controllers that will accept this input, send information to a service class, and return the appropriate result

	- Spring Data JPA
		- This is Spring's implementation of the Java Persistence API (JPA). It's used for interacting with relation databases (think SQL) so we can store our Java objects in some external source that persists past the life of the application
		- Recall an ORM (Obect-Relational Mapper) works as sort a translator between Java Objects and Relational Database entries. It works as a middleman to simplify the process of changing between the two formats. 

	- Spring Boot
		- Every Spring project has a name that's pretty accurate to what it's goal is (i.e. Spring Data allows you to work with Data, Spring Web allows you to work with Web traffic). Spring Boot's goal is to make it simple to "boot" up your application as simply as possible.
			- Opinionated Framework: Preset configurations for how you'll most likely end up using the other Spring Projects to save you time configuring (this was a pretty large problem with Spring before Spring Boot).
			- Auto-Configuration: Allow us to add in our classes as Beans very quickly and easily (Before you'd need something like a Beans.XML file, a Java Configuration File, or a ComponentScan Configuration File)
