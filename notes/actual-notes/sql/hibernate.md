# JPA and Hibernate

## ORM

Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a technique that lets you query and manipulate data from a database using an object-oriented paradigm. 
When talking about ORM, most people are referring to a library or framework that implements the Object-Relational Mapping technique, hence the phrase "an ORM".

## JPA vs. Hibernate (Specification vs. Implementation)

- Today, Hibernate ORM is one of the most mature JPA implementations, and still a popular option for ORM in Java.

- Java Persistence API is a collection of classes and methods to persistently store the vast amounts of data into a database which is provided by the Oracle Corporation.

- By itself, JPA is not a tool or framework; rather, it defines a set of concepts that can be implemented by any tool or framework.
